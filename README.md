# MNIST Digit Classification

This project explores two different approaches to building a neural network for classifying MNIST digits.

1.**TensorFlow from scratch** : A neural network is implemented manually using TensorFlow, covering all major components like forward pass, backpropagation, and optimization.This model gives an acuuracy of 86.97 %.

2.**Keras** : A high-level implementation using the Keras API, focusing on ease and simplicity in building the model , giving an accuracy of 97.36 %.

Both the implementations build a neural networks model with 2 hidden layers having 128 nodes each.
